# Assignment 4 Postmortem

## What's your name?

Aurora Havens

## How difficult was this assignment?

Very difficult because there were not a lot of helpful tutorials for a todo list. Just code dumps with which we had to glean from and work them into our own code.

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

I learned how to hook up angularjs to html as well as right a standard JS script. 


## How could this assignment be improved?

A plain walkthrough would have been helpful. There were too many things that needed to be incorporated but I did not have time to figure out how to incorporate them in time. I did not understand AngularJS the first time around and had to spend more time going over it and testing. 

## Any other comments?

Teach AngularJS. So far this class has been, "oh just learn it online to understand it". I quite well realize that my computer science degree can be obtained for free online but I am in this class to learn how to do it properly and to learn from a professor who has a few years of experience doing it. Some of these languages cannot be learned in a day. Bootstrap was lucky because it was well documented, HTML you can look up on codecademy, CSS has still yet to be taught in a way that actually makes sense in this class. Start over and teach it.
